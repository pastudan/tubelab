# TubeLab

Web ui for easily creating a youtube playlist. Features mobile web support via a unique QR code generated on the computer that is playing the youtube videos. 

Long term vision was a PC that was playing videos at parties, a simple drag and drop UI for desktop web, and a bunch of mobile web clients connected via websockets over the internet (no wifi needed). Imagine everyone at the party easily participating in being a DJ.
